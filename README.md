# Homework-11

Run pde.py will perform the relaxation method for question 1 and show the plot asked for.
gaussseidel.py is my attempt at the second part of question 1, but I had problems with it and it does not work. Running it should show a similar plot to the previous one, but it does not.
Run ftcs.py will perform calculations and show a static plot of the piano string. I tried to get the animated plot to work, but I could not figure that out either.
